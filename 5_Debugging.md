If you want to understand the parts involved and how they can be found and seen at work, you can use our under-construction platform https://www.activitree.com.

**Manifest:** your manifest details
**Service Workers:** find the status of you service worker, the last version installed.
**Clear storage:** clean and get a cleared state before you re-observe installation, activation and fetchin with a new service worker

**Cache Storage:** observe the folders created by your service worker and all the items in each and every folder.

Down below in the Console section, have those checkmarks in order to observe what is going on as you browse. When you turn debugging: true in your service worker, you can see the entire behavior logged.
